# Vehicle Fee Calculator Project

## Description

This project is an application that will allow a buyer to calculate the total price of a vehicle (common or luxury) at a car auction. The software must consider several costs in the calculation. The buyer must pay various fees for the transaction, all of which are calculated on the base price amount. The total amount calculated is the winning bid amount (vehicle base price) plus the fees based on the vehicle price and vehicle type. Fees must be dynamically computed.
